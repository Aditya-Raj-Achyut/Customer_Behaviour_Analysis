# 🚀 Customer Behavior Analysis | End-to-End Data Project
## 📌 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze a retail dataset to identify **Customer Purchasing Patterns**. This project covers the complete end-to-end data lifecycle: extracting raw data, cleaning and analyzing it using SQL and Python, and finally building an interactive Power BI dashboard to support data-driven business decisions.

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Extraction** — Raw dataset sourced from Kaggle. File included in repo: [customer_shopping_behavior.csv](customer_shopping_behavior.csv)
2. **Python + SQLAlchemy** — Loaded cleaned DataFrame into PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy (`create_engine`)
3. **SQL Analysis** — Wrote 8 business queries in pgAdmin 4 to calculate KPIs like Revenue per Customer, Churn Rate, and Customer Segmentation
4. **Python EDA** — Exploratory Data Analysis to detect outliers, handle missing values, and analyze correlations
5. **Dashboarding** — Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize high-level business insights
---
## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Customer Segmentation:** The 35–50 age demographic contributes ~45% of total revenue
- **Retention Issues:** ~20% of customers have not made a purchase in the last 6 months (High Churn Risk)
- **Category Performance:** The "Clothing" category has the highest profit margin (~12%) but also the highest return rate

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- **Loyalty Program:** Implement a reward system for high-spending segments (35–50 age group) to reduce churn
- **Marketing Strategy:** Focus social media ad spend on the 18–24 age group — they show high engagement despite lower current spending
- **Return Rate Management:** Investigate quality or sizing issues in the Clothing category to reduce return rates despite high profit margins
---
